            <p>
                I'm an aspiring software engineer with a budding passion for coding.
            </p>

            <p>
                While I'm still in the early stages of my journey, I've already started building projects with Python, HTML, and CSS and, currently, 
                I'm on an exciting pathway with FreeCodeCamp to earn some certifications and boost my skills.
            </p>

            <p id="not-on-small-screen">
                When I'm not immersed in the world of code, I like to give back to the community by volunteering. I also cherish my free time by exploring the little nooks and crannies around London, taking long, refreshing walks in the park, and soaking in the beauty of new sights around town.
    
            </p>

            <p>
                Join me on this adventure as I grow, learn, and have a little fun along the way!
